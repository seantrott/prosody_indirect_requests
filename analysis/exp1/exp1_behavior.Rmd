# Reading in data

```{r}
coded = read.csv("../../data/exp1/exp1_critical.csv")

```


# Can people detect a signal, generally?

## Descriptive

```{r}
mean(coded$correct)
sd(coded$correct)
```


## Analysis

A **glmer** model predictig *response* from *correct answer* explains more variance than a model without the fixed effect of *correct answer*. (Both models contain random slopes for items and subjects.) In other words, participants are sensitive overall to which utterance was intended as a request.

```{r}
m1 = glmer(data=coded, response ~ answer + (1 + answer | stimNum) +
             (1 + answer | subject),
           control=glmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa"),
         family=binomial())

m1.reduced =glmer(data=coded, response ~ (1 + answer | stimNum) +
                    (1 + answer | subject),
                  control=glmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa"),
                    family=binomial())

anova(m1,m1.reduced)
```

## Analysis

### Building the models
```{r}

m1 = glmer(data=coded, correct ~ form*speaker + (1 + speaker | stimNum) +
             (1 + form | subject),
           control=glmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa"),
         family=binomial())

m1.reduced =glmer(data=coded, correct ~ form + speaker + (1 + speaker | stimNum) +
                    (1 + form | subject),
                  control=glmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa"),
                    family=binomial())

m1.reduced.form = glmer(data=coded, correct ~ form + (1 + speaker | stimNum) +
                    (1 + form | subject),
                  control=glmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa"),
                    family=binomial())

m1.reduced.speaker = glmer(data=coded, correct ~ speaker + (1 + speaker | stimNum) +
                    (1 + form | subject),
                  control=glmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa"),
                    family=binomial())

m1.null = glmer(data=coded, correct ~ (1 + speaker | stimNum) +
                    (1 + form | subject),
                  control=glmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa"),
                    family=binomial())


```

### Model comparisons

All models constructed with random slopes for effect of speaker per item, and random slopes for effect form per subject.

**Summary**:  
* Model with interaction between *form* and *speaker* explains more variance than model with only fixed effects.   
* Model with both fixed effects better than models with only one (e.g. just form, or just speaker).  
* Models with only form, or only speaker, both better than null model.

```{r}
anova(m1, m1.reduced)
anova(m1.reduced, m1.reduced.form)
anova(m1.reduced, m1.reduced.speaker)
anova(m1.reduced.form, m1.null)
anova(m1.reduced.speaker, m1.null)
```

# Exploratory Analyses

## Effects of order?

```{r}
coded %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Order, y=correct)) +
  geom_point(stat="summary", fun.y="mean") + 
  stat_summary (fun.y = function(x){mean(x)},
                fun.ymin = function(x){mean(x) - 1*sd(x)/sqrt(length(x))},
                fun.ymax = function(x){mean(x) + 1*sd(x)/sqrt(length(x))},
                geom= 'pointrange', 
                position=position_dodge(width=0.95)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Order") +
  ylab("Accuracy") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0, 1)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(12, 24, 36, 48), linetype = "dotted")

```

### Analysis

A model with a fixed effect of order explains no more variance in accuracy than a model with no fixed effects.

```{r}


m1.order =glmer(data=coded, correct ~ Order + (1 | stimNum) +
                    (1 | subject),
                  control=glmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa"),
                  family=binomial())
m1.null =glmer(data=coded, correct ~ (1 | stimNum) +
                    (1 | subject),
                  control=glmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa"),
                  family=binomial())
anova(m1.order,m1.null)
```

### Order by block

It might also be the case that accuracy improves for each block, but not overall. 

Simply adding an interaction between order and speaker won't directly address whether people improve for a given speaker, because a given speaker could've occurred in the first block or the fifth block; this means that the overall trial number (as indexed by *order*) won't reflect the relative number of the trial *for that speaker* (e.g. comparing trial 11 to trial 24). 

Instead, we can *rescale* order to always be between 0-11, e.g. the *order of a trial within a block*. Below, we ask whether the relative order of a trial predicts its accuracy (e.g. whether people improve within each block), and whether this varies by speaker.

Based on model comparisons, we find weak evidence that the order within a block matters. Adding *order_by_block* improves the model over a null model, and over a model including a separate fixed effect for *speaker*. There's no evidence for an significant interaction between *order_by_block* and *speaker*. 

In other words, it is possible that participants improve slightly *within* each block, but they don't seem to improve overall. The amount that they improve within each block is not dependent on the speaker.

```{r}

coded$order_by_block = coded$Order %% 12
table(coded$order_by_block)




m1.order_with_speaker_interaction =glmer(data=coded, correct ~ order_by_block * speaker + (1 | stimNum) +
                    (1 | subject),
                  control=glmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa"),
                  family=binomial())

m1.order_plus_speaker =glmer(data=coded, correct ~ order_by_block + speaker + (1 | stimNum) +
                    (1 | subject),
                  control=glmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa"),
                  family=binomial())


m1.only_speaker =glmer(data=coded, correct ~ speaker + (1 | stimNum) +
                    (1 | subject),
                  control=glmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa"),
                  family=binomial())

m1.order_by_block =glmer(data=coded, correct ~ order_by_block + (1 | stimNum) +
                    (1 | subject),
                  control=glmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa"),
                  family=binomial())

m1.null =glmer(data=coded, correct ~ (1 | stimNum) +
                    (1 | subject),
                  control=glmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa"),
                  family=binomial())

anova(m1.order_with_speaker_interaction, m1.order_plus_speaker)
anova(m1.order_plus_speaker, m1.only_speaker)
anova(m1.order_by_block, m1.null)
```



# Discussion

Key takeaways: 

Overall, listeners are able to detect which of two utterances was intended as a request. This suggests that speakers are capable of producing discriminable cues when asked to.

Some speakers were better than others, however. Additionally, *Modal forms* were easier to discriminate than *Indirect Statements*. Finally, there were individual differences across subjects, though the distribution was left-skewed; considerably more subjects were more accurate than chance overall.

Analysis of accuracy by *order* suggests that participants didn't improve overall as the experiment went on. However, analysis of *within-block order* provides weak evidence that participants may improve slightly within each speaker-block; the magnitude of this improvement did not seem to depend on the particular speaker. In other words, participants don't get better at detecting intent *in general* over the course of the study, but *for each speaker*, they may improve over the course of those 12 trials. If this is true, it suggests that participants can **adapt** to a given speaker, but that this adaptation may not transfer to new speakers. (This seems at odds with the observation that similar acoustic features are predictive intent *across* speakers.)
